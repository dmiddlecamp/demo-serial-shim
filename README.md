Here's an example firmware and server that will publish data both online, and offline!  Run the server app from your 
ethernet connected machine, and use the firmware as an example template for your own apps!  Just be sure to include 
the SYSTEM_THREAD and SYSTEM_MODE settings in your firmware.  Enjoy!
